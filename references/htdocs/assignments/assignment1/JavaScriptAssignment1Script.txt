 1.  Add an image that you want to move and give it an id.
 
 2. Make an button with an onclick that calls a function.  You can add the onclick feature to the image itself or the hole page if you want im just doing a button for this example.
 
 3. Make a variable that equals document.getElementById("YOUR IMGAGES ID") , use the id from the image created in step 1 and assign it to a variable using variable equals document.getElementById
 

 4. Then make 2 functions, one for initialization, another for movement. in this example they are named init and moveRight.
 
 5.add 2 lines to the initialization the function.
 Setting the position to relative makes the image movable while still holding a place for it on the page.
 I chose to start at the left but you can initialize it to wherever you want the image to start.
 
 6. In the movement function add   duck.style.left = parseInt(duck.style.left) + 10 + 'px';  
    The parseInt duck.style.left gets the value in pixels of how far left the image is. then you add on the number of pixels that you want it to move by. 
    By adding on more pixels to the style.left it will push the image further and further to the right of the page as you push the button.
 
 7 . Finaly add window.onload = inititialization function();   Used so that as soon as the page loads up it will initialize the duck image and make it possible to move.
