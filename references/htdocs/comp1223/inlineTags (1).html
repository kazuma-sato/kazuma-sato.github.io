	ease. <em>Emphasis</em> is close to <i>italic</i> but they are slightly different. You can <u>underline</u> things you want to
	stand out and even provide a <cite>citation</cite> for important references. You can <abbr title="abbreviate">abbr.</abbr> long names,
	or even use <sup>superscript</sup> for math! Some thing that don't get used very obtain include a <kbd>keyboard entry</kbd>
