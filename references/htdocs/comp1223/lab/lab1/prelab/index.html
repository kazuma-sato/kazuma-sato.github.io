				<p>Hello. My name is Kazuma Sato. I'm a Japanese Canadian. I was born in Japan, raised here in Toronto. I do not enjoy writing about myself so please forgive me if this is a boring read. </p>
				<p>I've been in the food/service industry for the past 10 years and I love it. Currently, I am a server, and barista at a little restaurant in Rosedale. I take pride in the espresso based coffees I make. I've been making them for 10 years. I think I make a pretty mean latte.</p>
				<p>I believe I am very good at my job. The guests I serve usually enjoy the service I provide.</p>
				<p>I really enjoy food. I like to try new restaurants, or cooking at home with friends with a few bottles of wine or a case of beer. Italian and Japanese cuisine is by far my favorite but I am willing to try anything within reason once.</p>
				<p>I think I'm pretty good with computers and networking but I do need to work on coding.</p>
				<p>I went to the University York to do my undergrad in music playing the cello but I wasn't able to afford it so I dropped out. I have decided to go a completely different route and go to college and take a Computer Systems Technician program.</p>
				<p>I am also the assistant director for Operation Services a non-profit, fan-run anime convention called Anime North. I run a department for crowd control and convention policy for this event for 28,500 fans. </p>
